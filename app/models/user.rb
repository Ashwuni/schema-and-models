  def favorite_book
#       Add a method named favorite_book to the User model that returns a userâ€™s 
#       favorite book based on their ratings. The item returned should be a Book object 
#       and not an ActiveRecord::Relation. If a user has no ratings, return nil.
      
      if ratings.count == 0
          return nil

#    def books_in_common id
# # #       Add a method named books_in_common to the User model that takes 
# # #       as input the id of another user and returns an array of Book objects 
# # #       that both users have given positive ratings to. If the two users have 
# # #       no such books in common, return an empty array.

# #       common = Array.new
# #       for i in 0..ratings.count
# #           for j in 0..ratings.where(book_id: id).count
